# VBS-Scripts

- Generic macros I've developed that do NOT contain any confidential company information.  

- This repo is for purposes of version control.

- Used for utility functions, such as copying PDF files from a network drive, or automatically converting files.  For example, one is used for pulling auto-generated PDF reports into a folder that are generated each month in a different folder, matching a certain substring.  It grabs all PDFS created within a certain date range as well to make sure none are missed.
